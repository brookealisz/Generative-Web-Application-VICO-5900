        <h1>Kaleidoscopic Neighborhood</h1>
        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This Generative Web Application is javascript-based and features kaleidoscopic visuals that can be manipulated by user input. Please use the controls in the upper-right corner to alter the variables. <br><br>The primary visual of this application consists of a gird, which may be thought of as houses in a 'neighborhood.' A color-changing background lives behind these houses, and music plays over the neighborhood. The background color may be changed by clicking the mouse anywhere in the browser. The number of squares that form each house can be changed via slider, as can the distance between each house. The neighborhood may be distant and controlled, or it may be crowded and hecticâ€” it's up to the user! The volume of the music may also be controlled via slider. </p>
